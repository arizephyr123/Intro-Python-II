# Implement a class to hold room information. This should have name and
# description attributes.
# Put the Room class in `room.py` based on what you see in `adv.py`.

#   * The room should have `name` and `description` attributes.

#   * The room should also have `n_to`, `s_to`, `e_to`, and `w_to` attributes
#     which point to the room in that respective direction.

# * The `Room` class should be extended with a `list` that holds the `Item`s
    # that are currently in that room.
